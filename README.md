# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is my submission for the *Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project*.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data set with data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

Within this repository you will find the following files:
* The R Script *run_analysis.R* which is used to conduct the data wrangling.
* A code book titled *CodeBook.md* detailing the code within the above script.
* The resulting tidy data set which is output as *tidy_data.csv*.

Per the project outline, the R Script is required to complete the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
